Jump over the obstacles to complete the mission!

This program is one of the first interactive games I have created using Javascript.
I was able to learn this with the help of a Youtube channel by the name of Knife Circus.

It is similar to the google dinosaur game available on Google Chrome browser when there is no internet access. 
The user is able to left mouse click in order to jump above obstacles.
